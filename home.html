      I was angry with my friend; I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry
      with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I waterd it in fears,
      Night & morning with my tears: And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft
      deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night. Till it bore an apple
      bright. And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine. And into
      my garden stole, When the night had veild the pole; In the morning glad I
      see; My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
